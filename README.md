[![Flattr this git repo](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=beworker&url=https://github.com/beworker/tinybus&title=tinybus&language=java&tags=github&category=software)

Faster implementation of [Otto][2] event bus with additional features you missed.

Version 3.0 (in test)
=======
  - [x] Background processing queues
  - [x] Post delayed events
  - [x] Full Gradle support (Ant build is obsolate)
 
TinyBus is
=======
 - tiny (~ 26K jar)
 - fast (optimized for startup and event dispatching)
 - well tested (> 90 junit tests)
 - annotation based (no requiremens on method names, no interfaces to implement)

TinyBus API in a nutshell
=======
 - `@Subscribe` annotates event handler methods running in the main thread.
 - `@Subscribe(mode=Mode.Background)` annotates event handler methods running in a background thread.
 - `@Subscribe(mode=Mode.Background, queue="web")` annotates event handler methods running in a serialized background queue.
 - `@Produce` annotates methods delivering most recent events (aka sticky events).
 - `Bus.register(Object)` and `Bus.unregister(Object)` register and unregister objects with subscriber and producer methods.
 - `Bus.hasRegistered(Object)` checks, whether given object is registered.
 - `Bus.post(Object)` posts given event object.
 - `Bus.postDelayed(Object, long)` and `Bus.cancelDelayed(Class)` schedules event delivery for later in time and cancels it.

For a more detailed example check out [Getting started][4] step-by-step guide or example application.

Performance reference tests
=======
![tinybus][3]

Executed on Nexus 5 device (Android 5.0.1, ART, screen off).

TinyBus extensions (still in 'Î²')
=======

Extensions is a unique feature of TinyBus. With it you can easily subscribe to commonly used events like battery level, connectivity change, phone shake event or even standard Android broadcast Intents. Here is a short example.

```java
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    private Bus mBus;
        
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        
        // get bus instance and wire device shake event
        mBus = TinyBus.from(this).wire(new ShakeEventWire());
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void onStart() {
        super.onStart();
	    mBus.register(this);
	}
	
    @Override
    protected void onStop() {
        mBus.unregister(this);
        super.onStop();
    }
    
    @Subscribe
    public void onShakeEvent(ShakeEvent event) {
        // device has been shaken
    }
}
```
More detailed usage example can be found in example application.

Build
=======

1. git clone git@github.com:beworker/tinybus.git
2. cd <git>/tinybus
3. gradle build (or ant release)

Execute JUnit tests
=======

1. cd <git>/tinybus-tests
2. ant test

Gradle dependencies
=======

For pure event bus implementation
```
dependencies {
    compile 'de.halfbit:tinybus:2.1.+'
}
```
For event bus with extensions
```
dependencies {
    compile 'de.halfbit:tinybus:2.1.+'
    compile 'de.halfbit:tinybus-extensions:2.1.+'
}
```

Proguard configuration (Version 2.1.x and below)
=======

```
-keepclassmembers class ** {
    @com.halfbit.tinybus.Subscribe public *;
    @com.halfbit.tinybus.Produce public *;
}

-keepclassmembers enum com.halfbit.tinybus.Subscribe$Mode {
	public *;
}
```

Proguard configuration (Since version 3)
=======

```
-keepclassmembers class ** {
    @de.halfbit.tinybus.Subscribe public *;
    @de.halfbit.tinybus.Produce public *;
}
```
